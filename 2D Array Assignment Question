Assignment 1
Question: 01 Marks: 10
You are planning to develop a weather monitoring system that records daily temperatures (in °C) for 7 consecutive days across 5 different cities in Bangladesh. Your task is to develop a C program that processes this data. The program should calculate city-wise average temperatures, classify weather conditions (Hot, Moderate, Cold), count extreme weather alert days, and determine the highest and lowest temperatures recorded. Additionally, the program should compute day-wise average temperatures across all cities and report the hottest and coldest days based on those averages.
Input: The program should first take temperature inputs and store them in a 2D array, where each row represents a city and each column represents a day. You must ensure that each temperature value entered lies within the valid range of 5°C to 60°C. If an invalid temperature is entered, the program should display a warning and prompt the user to re-enter the value.
Output: For each city, the program should calculate the average temperature of the week and classify the weather condition as "Hot", "Moderate", or "Cold". A city is considered "Hot" if the average temperature is 30°C or above, "Moderate" if it is between 20°C and 29.9°C, and "Cold" if it is below 20°C. Additionally, the program should count how many days in the week had extreme weather conditions for each city: specifically, days where the temperature exceeded 40°C (counted as Heat Alert days) and days where it fell below 10°C (counted as Cold Alert days). This summary should be displayed city-wise, including the average temperature, weather type, and alert counts.
After processing all cities, the program should identify and display the city that recorded the highest single-day temperature and the city that recorded the lowest single-day temperature.
Finally, the program should compute and display the average temperature for each of the 7 days across all cities, and determine which day had the highest and lowest average temperature.
